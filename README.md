#GitHub Guidelines

## Branches

- The main branch contains the last stable version of the code and this is the version that is deployed.
- For every update that we want to develop we create a new branch with a appropriate name

We can also create an issue or choose an existing one and then [create a branch to work for this issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue "create a branch to work for this issue").
### Pull Requests

Whenever we want to change something in the main branch (for example fixing a bug) the only way we can do this is with a pull request (simply pushing to main is disabled).
Each pull request should be approved by designated users (senior developers) and to be able to merge all the chosen test must be passed 

## Issues

Issues should be created for every change that we want to do to the code. Each issue should have a title that is easy to understand and an appropriate label. Like mentioned above we can also create a new branch that is assosiated with an issue to work on the issue and when it is resolved we can create a pull request to the main branch.
